## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a coral identification model. Using pictures of coral frags, can we reliably identify the type of coral? How specific can we get with this identification?

## Obtaining Training Data

The first step is to obtain the training data. I am beginning with pictures posted on [Reef2Reef.com](www.Reef2Reef.com) during live sales, as thousands of corals are posted in each live sale. I am also beginning with the live sales from World Wide Corals (WWC), because the first live sale I ever participated in was put on by WWC, they provide quality corals, and they have tons of images available from their numerous live sales. You can view pictures of coral frags currently for sale by WWC on their website [worldwidecorals.com](worldwidecorals.com).

### BTW: What is a Live Sale?

If you are wondering what a Live Sale is, this is similar to an auction that occurs on the forums of the Reef2Reef website. Pictures of coral frags (small pieces of coral cut off from the mother colony) are posted on the forums, and the first person to purchase the listed coral wins. Usually, many good deals are provided, and rare corals are sometimes offered. These sales can last hours (or even an entire weekend). It is a fun way for people to buy corals for their reef tanks and to spend time with other reefers and vendors.
